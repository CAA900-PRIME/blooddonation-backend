### Project Overview
This web application is designed to simplify blood donation by directly connecting donors and requester without intermediaries. All users register under a single system, where they can act as both donors and requesters. Once registered, users needing blood can submit a request, while donors simply wait to receive notifications about nearby requests. The goal is to make the donation process faster and more efficient, reducing the time involved in finding a suitable donor. The platform prioritizes simplicity, ensuring a user-friendly experience with minimal steps.
